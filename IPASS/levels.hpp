 /// well, in the .cpp are the definitions, here are the declarations,
 /// but you know what i mean.
 /// there are a lot of private values:
 /// move values for the player,
 /// saved values of the player (for faster clearing),
 /// move values for the npc (non-playing character),
 /// saved values of the npc (again for faster clearing),
 /// on what level the ground should be,
 /// the radius of the player,
 /// and a boolean to check if the player is in the air or not. (this will be explained with the fysics funtion)
 /// 
 /// Also there are two enumerations with the button values, the first enumeration is for the buttons what return on the fourth bye
 /// and the second enumeration is for the button values that return on the fifth byte.
